0.02 Tues. March 21, 2006
    * Moose
      - many more tests, fixing some bugs and  
        edge cases
      - &extends now loads the base module with
        UNIVERSAL::require 
        - added UNIVERSAL::require to the 
          dependencies list
      ** API CHANGES **
      - each new Moose class will also create 
        and register a subtype of Object which 
        correspond to the new Moose class.      
      - the 'isa' option in &has now only 
        accepts strings, and will DWIM in 
        almost all cases
    
    * Moose::Util::TypeConstraints
      - added type coercion features
        - added tests for this
        - added support for this in attributes 
          and instance construction
      ** API CHANGES **
      - type construction no longer creates a 
        function, it registers the type instead.
        - added several functions to get the 
          registered types 

    * Moose::Object
      - BUILDALL and DEMOLISHALL were broken 
        because of a mis-named hash key, Whoops :)
    
    * Moose::Meta::Attribute
      - adding support for coercion in the
        autogenerated accessors
        
    * Moose::Meta::Class
      - adding support for coercion in the
        instance construction  

    * Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint
    * Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion
	  - type constraints and coercions are now 
	    full fledges meta-objects
