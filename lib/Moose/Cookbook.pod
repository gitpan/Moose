Moose::Cookbook - How to cook a Moose

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Moose cookbook is a series of recipies taken from the Moose 
test suite. Each recipe presents some code, which demonstrates 
some of the features of Moose, and then proceeds to explain the 
details of the code. 

We also provide a L<Moose::Cookbook::FAQ> and a L<Moose::Cookbook::WTF>
for common questions and problems people have with Moose.
